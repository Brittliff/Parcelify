        Parcelify let you create simple yet powerful shipping rates based on address fields,
        products, total weight or price. Whether you'd like to create a "5$ Bike delivery"
        shipping rates for your neighbors, a "Free hand delivery" for your coworkers or an
        expensive 25$ "Plane delivery" for that remote region in your country, we've got your back.
        Oh! you want that rate only for orders above $100? You can do that, too!
